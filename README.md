🌟 Overview
A secure implementation of PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) algorithm with a user-friendly web interface built using Streamlit. This application provides encryption and decryption capabilities using PBKDF2 for key derivation, making password-based encryption more secure through the use of salt and multiple iterations.
